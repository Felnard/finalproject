        Yes, Bob Saget has starred in many successful television shows,
        including two of the most family-friendly shows network TV has ever
        produced (Full House and Americas Funniest Home Videos) but he’s also an
        out of his mind, Grammy-nominated standup comedian for over thirty
        years. From his latest Amazon special, Zero to Sixty, to his HBO special
        That Ain't Right to his scene-stealing cameos in Entourage, and The
        Aristocrats, it’s always effective as Saget embraces his mischievous
        side. From directing MGM’s cult favorite feature film Dirty Work, to
        directing and producing the highly acclaimed ABC television movie, For
        Hope, to starring in the critically acclaimed, Paul Weitz off-Broadway
        play, Privilege, to starring on Broadway in the Tony Award winning The
        Drowsy Chaperone, Bob Saget shows no signs of stopping. Ever.

      <p class="about">
        In 2014, Bob completed his first Australian theater tour visiting
        Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. Bob continued touring, playing to
        sold out audiences in theaters and universities across North America and
        in 2012 he hosted the Montreal Comedy Festival’s first live 90 minute
        JFL XXX TV show which continues to air across Canada on The Movie
        Network. His 2013 one-hour stand-up special, That’s What I’m Talkin’
        About, was nominated for a 2014 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. The
        special was filmed at The Moore Theatre in Seattle, premiered on
        Showtime in May 2013 and is now available on multiple platforms, both as
        a comedy album and special.

      <p class="about">
        Bob’s first book is a New York Times Best Seller - DIRTY DADDY was
        released on April 8, 2014 to critical acclaim with Vanity Fair calling
        it, “Hilarious and at times heartbreaking.” The book is also available
        as an audio book, recorded by Bob. In January 2016, Bob finished a very
        fulfilling and successful 9-week run on Broadway in the Tony-nominated
        play, Hand To God, playing the part of a Lutheran minister, Pastor Greg.
        That year he also co-starred in the film, A Stand Up Guy and began his
        six season run on the hit Netflix series, Fuller House which ended
        shooting in 2020. In 2018, Bob made his London performance debut at the
        Leicester Square Theatre, and can’t wait to return to perform there when
        the times allow.

      <p class="about">
        On April 23, 2019, Bob’s independent film, Benjamin, was released as the
        first Redbox Original release and it is also available on many streaming
        platforms. Bob directed and starred with an amazing ensemble cast: Rob
        Corddry, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Kevin Pollak, Cheri Oteri, Dave Foley, Max
        Burkholder, Clara Mamet, David Hull, Jonny Weston, and Peri Gilpin. The
        film was produced by Nicholas Tabarrok. In this original dark comedy, Ed
        (Bob Saget), reluctantly calls together an oddball assortment of friends
        and family to intervene on the supposed drug habit of his 15-year-old
        son, Benjamin (Max Burkholder). What quickly follows is a night of
        finger-pointing, petty thievery, adulterous backstabbing, and a seesaw
        of crooked emotional revelations — all leading to the misguided but
        sincere attempt to heal this dysfunctional family. In 2019, Bob hosted
        the new CMT TV series, Nashville Squares.

        amazing guests, including: Tiffany Haddish, Jason Sudeikis, Whoopi
        Goldberg, Norman Lear, Regina Hall, Bill Burr, John Mayer, Candace
        Cameron Bure, Cedric the Entertainer, John Stamos, Jake Tapper, Nikki
        Glaser, Jon Hamm and Bob Newhart. Last fall, Bob performed at Dave
        Chappelle’s Summer Camp, which he just did again in May, 2021, appeared
        on the hit Fox TV show I Can See Your Voice, and performed as Squiggly
        Monster on The Masked Singer.

      <p class="about">
