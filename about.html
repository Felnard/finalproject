      Yes, Bob Saget has starred in many successful television shows, including
      two of the most family-friendly shows network TV has ever produced (Full
      House and Americas Funniest Home Videos) but he’s also an out of his mind,
      Grammy-nominated standup comedian for over thirty years. From his latest
      Amazon special, Zero to Sixty, to his HBO special That Ain't Right to his
      scene-stealing cameos in Entourage, and The Aristocrats, it’s always
      effective as Saget embraces his mischievous side. From directing MGM’s
      cult favorite feature film Dirty Work, to directing and producing the
      highly acclaimed ABC television movie, For Hope, to starring in the
      critically acclaimed, Paul Weitz off-Broadway play, Privilege, to starring
      on Broadway in the Tony Award winning The Drowsy Chaperone, Bob Saget
      shows no signs of stopping. Ever. In 2007 came the hugely successful DVD
      release of Farce of the Penguins, an R-rated comedy/documentary/love
      story, that he voiced-over, wrote, directed, and produced, with producer
      David Permut. And then came the hit NBC quiz show 1 VS 100, where Bob
      ad-libbed his way through the one-hour prime time format. In 2008, The
      Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget premiered to the second highest ratings
      of all TV that night, second only to the Olympics. For many years now, Bob
      has been a proud board member of the Scleroderma Research Foundation. He
      co-produces and hosts "Cool Comedy Hot Cuisine" fundraising events in Los
      Angeles, New York, Las Vegas and San Francisco. To date, they have raised
      over 53 million dollars for the SRF going directly to research to cure
      this disease. Bob was seen several times reprising the role of “Himself”
      on HBO’s hit series Entourage as well as a cameo in the film. He also
      starred in his own documentary comedy series for A&E titled, Strange Days
      with Bob Saget, an exploration of unusual subcultures in America. In 2014,
      Bob completed his first Australian theater tour visiting Brisbane, Sydney,
      Melbourne and Perth. Bob continued touring, playing to sold out audiences
      in theaters and universities across North America and in 2012 he hosted
      the Montreal Comedy Festival’s first live 90 minute JFL XXX TV show which
      continues to air across Canada on The Movie Network. His 2013 one-hour
      stand-up special, That’s What I’m Talkin’ About, was nominated for a 2014
      Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. The special was filmed at The Moore
      Theatre in Seattle, premiered on Showtime in May 2013 and is now available
      on multiple platforms, both as a comedy album and special. Bob’s first
      book is a New York Times Best Seller - DIRTY DADDY was released on April
      8, 2014 to critical acclaim with Vanity Fair calling it, “Hilarious and at
      times heartbreaking.” The book is also available as an audio book,
      recorded by Bob. In January 2016, Bob finished a very fulfilling and
      successful 9-week run on Broadway in the Tony-nominated play, Hand To God,
      playing the part of a Lutheran minister, Pastor Greg. That year he also
      co-starred in the film, A Stand Up Guy and began his six season run on the
      hit Netflix series, Fuller House which ended shooting in 2020. In 2018,
      Bob made his London performance debut at the Leicester Square Theatre, and
      can’t wait to return to perform there when the times allow. Bob’s newest
      hour-long stand-up special, Zero To Sixty, was shot in Brooklyn at The
      Williamsburg Hall of Music in May 2017. Zero To Sixty premiered worldwide
      on November 14, 2017 on multiple digital platforms including Amazon Prime,
      iTunes, Comcast, DirecTV, and many others. It's also available as a comedy
      album including vinyl LPs as well as streaming and downloads for all
      forms. On April 23, 2019, Bob’s independent film, Benjamin, was released
      as the first Redbox Original release and it is also available on many
      streaming platforms. Bob directed and starred with an amazing ensemble
      cast: Rob Corddry, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Kevin Pollak, Cheri Oteri, Dave
      Foley, Max Burkholder, Clara Mamet, David Hull, Jonny Weston, and Peri
      Gilpin. The film was produced by Nicholas Tabarrok. In this original dark
      comedy, Ed (Bob Saget), reluctantly calls together an oddball assortment
      of friends and family to intervene on the supposed drug habit of his
      15-year-old son, Benjamin (Max Burkholder). What quickly follows is a
      night of finger-pointing, petty thievery, adulterous backstabbing, and a
      seesaw of crooked emotional revelations — all leading to the misguided but
      sincere attempt to heal this dysfunctional family. In 2019, Bob hosted the
      new CMT TV series, Nashville Squares.. On April 20, 2020, Bob launched his
      podcast, Bob Saget’s Here For You, now at 100 episodes, featuring Bob’s
      one of a kind stream of consciousness storytelling and real and honest
      conversations with amazing guests, including: Tiffany Haddish, Jason
      Sudeikis, Whoopi Goldberg, Norman Lear, Regina Hall, Bill Burr, John
      Mayer, Candace Cameron Bure, Cedric the Entertainer, John Stamos, Jake
      Tapper, Nikki Glaser, Jon Hamm and Bob Newhart. Last fall, Bob performed
      at Dave Chappelle’s Summer Camp, which he just did again in May, 2021,
      appeared on the hit Fox TV show I Can See Your Voice, and performed as
      Squiggly Monster on The Masked Singer. Bob just wrapped shooting the dark
      comedy film, Blue Iguana, in the Cayman Islands, alongside Joel David
      Moore, Jason Jones, Carly Chaikin, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Chantel Riley, and
      Iggy Pop. It was directed by Jeremey LaLonde and Produced by Nicholas
      Tabarrok. The story involves a dying man (Pop) who will leave his entitled
      children his fortune only if they can spend the weekend together in his
      Cayman Islands home. They end up trying to murder one of their siblings in
      order to get his share of the fortune. Bob is overjoyed to be back on his
      stand-up tour with a new hour plus of material with dates scheduled all
      over North America, happening right now.
